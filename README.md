# is-25-perceivable-
a survey app that checks if 25% increase in change is actually perceivable change

## Idea
1. User is shown a bar
2. Then the app will increase the bar's length by a random percentage
3. The user will click if the bar's length changed
4. The result will be pushed to database to be averaged by other users' score
